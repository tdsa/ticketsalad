	\title{Ticket Salad Testing Policy}
	\date{}
	\maketitle
	We were not able to implement automated testing as we are using meteor and that is a new working environment to us. We encountered many errors and problems when attempting to test. We then contacted the client and they said that they will assist us but at a later stage.
	
	\section{Testing plan}
	Our testing follows a simple plan. We start with unit testing by ensuring that individual modules produced the correct output. 
	
	We then test whether or not modules are able to integrate correctly by checking output and then we test the systems ability as a whole.
