	\section{Pre-test planning}
	Before the usability test, a number of steps were taken to ensure the test went as smoothly as possible and didn’t cause any confusion for our user testers. Each user was provided with device with the latest version of the app installed.
	\newline
	The specific tasks chosen to be carried out by the users were a result of figuring out what tasks would be performed most often during general use of the app as well as tasks that were vital to portray the app’s functional requirements. Since these tasks define the general functionality of the app, they were predicted to provided the most accurate data to the findings that needed to be made.
	\section{Tasks performed by users}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The user was asked to create an account and use these details to log into the app. The aim of this was to see if there was any confusion on what details needed to be entered and the general process of signing in.
		\item The user was asked to view all events that were currently up in order to see if they could navigate the main page without any problems.
		\item The user was asked to view their profile in order to see their details.
		\item The user was asked to buy more claims in order to top up their claim balance.
		\item The user was asked to add a new credit card when paying for the claims.
		\item The user was asked to edit their profile to change their user handle.
		\item The user was asked to search for a specific event with the search function.
		\item The user was asked to try claim a bid on the above event
		\item The user was finally asked to sign out the app.
	\end{itemize}
	\section{External Viewing and evaluation}
	During the testing of the application we had a developer observe each tester and keep track of the following agendas.
	\subsection{Success Rate}
	Success rate was a measurement of how many errors were made per task, 5 being no errors and 1 being many errors (Each error subtracted 1 from the score). The reason we chose this is to see if the user just took long to find out how to perform a task or if they attempted performing the task in an incorrect manner.
	\subsection{Errors Made}
	We kept track of the errors made so that we could know what errors the users making so that we can adjust the application to remove the chances of these errors occurring.
	\section{Conclusion}
	In conclusion, the user testing provided us with valuable feedback. Most of the users had no problems navigating the app and completing tasks. Tasks that seemed to show the most difficulty (albeit very minor difficulty) was logging out and buying claims. Most users searched for the logout button in the main menu, one user even suggested adding the logout button to the main navigation menu. Buying claims also showed a bit of difficulty as most users weren’t sure where to locate the buy claims screen. Every user however claimed the app was very intuitive and there were no major complaints.
