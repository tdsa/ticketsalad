	\section{System Overview}
	\subsection{Purpose}
	The purpose of the TicketSalad application is to provide users with a platform which they are able to spend a minimal amount of money in order to stand a chance to win a ticket valued at a significant amount with ease.
	\subsection{Project Scope}
	The TicketSalad system is a lottery based ticket platform. A user registers their email and credentials, they then purchase credits. Using these credits, user's can 'bid' on events displayed to them. When the user bids on an event they are required to input a 6 digit number. If the 6 digit number they input is the same number that the application randomly generated, the user wins the ticket.
